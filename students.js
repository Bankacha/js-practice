// Example of for loop to use instead of using forEach (remove this when start):
for (let student of students) {
    console.log(student);
}


// Write code for:

//  1. Calculation and print of average rank of all students



//  2. Calculation and print average rank of female students



//  4. Calculation and print of sum of male students ranks



//  5. Building two new arrays, one with male students, another with female



//  6. Finding the student who has the biggest rank



//  7. Finding the female student who has the smallest rank



// 8. Calculation and print average rank of students who has rank over 7

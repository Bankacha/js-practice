const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17];

// Example of for loop to use instead of using forEach (remove this when start):
for (let num of array) {
    console.log(num);
}

// 1.  Write code that calculates and print a sum of array


// 2.  Write code that calculates and print the average value of array


// 3.  * Write code that builds new reverse array (see https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_loop_for.asp)


// 4.  * Write code that prints the middle element if exist and null if not
